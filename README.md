Hospital Management System is basically a console-based Computer system that helps manage the information related to Health Care and Aids in the job completion of health care providers effectively. In my system, all the information related to hospital can be stored in an effective manner. Admin can manage the information related to hospital and Doctors can manage the information related to patients effectively.
Its basic aim is to provide a paper-less hospital up to 90%.
It helps in processing and management of hospital information not only inside the boundary but also beyond the hospital boundary. Admin can store all the information related to staff and patients in an effective way.
It helps in solving the complications from managing all the paper work of hospital with confidentiality. It also provides the facility to manage all the paper-work in one place, reducing the work of staff in arranging and analyzing the paper-work.
Hospital Management System brings together all the information and processes of a hospital, in a single platform.
